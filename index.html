<P> Welcome to my web page! I was bron and raised in New Haven Connecticut. The best city in the entire world. Home of Yale university and white clam pizza.
That may sound like an odd topping for a pizza but I assure you it is the best pizza on the planet. 
I am an only child but always had a dog growing up. My poodle mix Mike passed away right after I applied to college.
 I started to play lacrosse in middle school and played until junior  year of highschool. 
I also am very interested in music. I have a wide range of taste ranging from the Beatles, to Al Green, then to Kendrick Lamar 
On this website you will find brief information about me, links to music,photos, links and some other resources. </P>
